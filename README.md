## Svelte

> cybernetics (noun) - The science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things.

The burgeoning description of Svelte beginning to take hold across the web is this: *"Cybernetically enhanced web apps."* but what does that mean exactly and how did it come to be described in such a cool, and maybe slightly mysterious, way? 

---

Svelte started out as Ractive.js but in November 2016 version 1 was released under its current moniker. Since those humble beginnings it has grown exponentially in popularity.

The explosive growth can likely be attributed to two things. First, the approachability of the code base. It is easy to understand and takes a short amount of time to grasp before one can start building some seriously cool web apps with it. Second, Svelte apps are fast, very fast. The compiled finished product is much much smaller than almost any other framework language out there. 

The benefits of Svelte are many and its drawbacks are few. However, if you are reading this then you probably already know this on one level or another. 

### Where do we go from here?

The purpose of Svelte Society is to capitalize on the strengths of Svelte by creating a centralized community and a resource for both the seasoned developer and the code newbie just breaking into the scene. While capitalizing on Svelte's strengths this will enable the community to address Svelte's only drawbacks: 

- The frameworks lack of usage (according to the [State of JavaScript 2019](https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/svelte/) only 7.8% of respondents had used Svelte.).
- The lack of tooling (check out our ever growing [cookbook](https://sveltesociety.dev/recipes) and if you have any ideas we would love to hear them).

### Getting Involved
