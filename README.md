### Svelte

The burgeoning description of Svelte beginning to take hold across the web is this: "Cybernetically enhanced web apps" but what does that mean exactly and how did it come to be described in such a cool, and maybe slightly mysterious, way? 

Svelte started out as Ractive.js but in November 2016 version 1 was released under its current moniker. Since those humble beginnings it has grown in popularity exponentially.

The explosive growth can likely be attributed to two things. First the approachability of the code base. It is easy to understand and takes a short amount of time to grasp before one can start building some seriously cool web apps with it. Second Svelte apps are fast, very fast. The compiled finished product is much much smaller than almost any other framework language out there. 

The benefits of Svelte are many and its drawbacks are few. However, if you are reading this then you probably already know this on one level or another. 

## Where do we go from here?

The purpose of Svelte Society is to capitalize on the strengths of Svelte by creating a centralized community and a resource for both the seasoned developer and the code newbie just breaking into the scene. The aim of Svelte Society is to address perhaps the largest drawback to Svelte: its lack of usage and support network (according to the State of JavaScript 2019 only 7.8% of respondents had used Svelte.).
